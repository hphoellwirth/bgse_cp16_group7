  <h2>Results</h2>
	<h3>Map</h3>
  <p>The data suggests that air pollution is a local problem, i.e. differences in observed 
     concentration level between close cities can be large. The point is best illustrated
     with the NO2 pollution level of Glasgow and Edinburgh.</p>	
  <p>However, the map also illustrates that pollution level can also be influenced by 
     national policies. This is best illustrated with Bulgaria and PM2.5, and Poland and O3.
     concentration level between close cities can be large. The point is best illustrated
     with the NO2 pollution level of Glasgow and Edinburgh.</p>     
  
  <h3>Data</h3>
  <p>The data view illustrates that both concentration level and national pollutant emissions
     were decreasing over the past 10-20 years (with very few exceptions). </p>  
     
  <h3>Descriptive Analysis</h3>
  <p>No statistical significant correlations between national emissions and city station
     concentration level. Likely explanation: national emission level are too general.
     Would need city level emission data to find significant relation.</p>
  <p>However, we observed that the size of population in most countries has a significant 
     positive correlation on the concentration level. </p>
  <p>We also conducted some sensitivity analysis on the pollutant concentration level. 
     In particular, we were interested whether the addition of new stations had any
     signifiant impact on the concentration means. The analysis compares the mean of
     all stations with the mean of stations added before 2000 and 2005, respectively.
     The output suggests that the addition of new station indeed reduced the mean concentration
     in a number of country-pollutant combinations (give example), but we also found several
     examples that showed the opposite impact (give example).</p>
  
  <h3>Predictive Analysis</h3>
  <p>Since no statistical significant correlations with sufficient R-squared could be 
     obtained from the dataset, the pollutant concentration predictions for the years
     2014-2018 rely on time-series analysis.</p>	
  <p>Time-series analysis was conducted both on station-level and national level. 
     Using the station-level predictions also allowed for estimations of the percentage of 
     stations above the limit for future years.</p>    
  <p>On average, station-level predictions look more realistic (no periodic trends).
     Add: lower error bounds, station-level often show no trend (not enough years of data
     add many stations do not allow for a statistical significant trend projection</p>
